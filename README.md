## About the Project

- This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.
- Start by setting up your project environment. Make sure Node is installed from the terminal. Install the packages `Express`, `Body-Parser`, and `Cors` from the terminal and them include them your `server.js` file.
  Create a server running on the port of your choosing.
- Create API credentials on [OpenWeatherMap](OpenWeatherMap.com).
- You should use `GET Route` for both Server Side & Client Side then use `POST Route` to be able to add an entry to the project endpoint using a POST route setup on the server side and executed on the client side as an asynchronous function.
- Sets the properties of existing HTML elements from the DOM using `Vanilla JavaScript`.
